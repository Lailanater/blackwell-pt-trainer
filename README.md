### Project Overview

This is an Android appliciation that will help US soldiers better train for the Army Phyisical Fitness Test (APFT). The workouts derive from my friend's unit who developed this program in order to help soldiers struggling with the APFT. The overall goal is that this app will be easily distributed and give soldiers a clean interface with all the tools they need to complete workouts and keep track of them from their respective smartphones.

#### Features

##### A
* Main screen listing all workouts to be completed
* Custom Icon
* Workouts tab showing all the workouts and their discriptions that are performed throughout the program
* Database to store progress

##### B
* Tips for common injuries and prevention methods
* Login page
* Settings page
* Timers during workouts for pushups, situps, etc.

##### C
* Stats tab displaying progress, improvement
* GPS tracking for runs
  * Tells you when to start and stop your run
  * Possibly more stats for pace, total runtime, etc.
* Facebook support
  * Login with Facebook
    * Display Facebook profile picture and cover photo in side menu
  * Interact with Facebook groups to post results of workouts
* Push notifications

#### Users
Primarily US soldiers, whether active duty or National Guard, but could be used by anyone who is into fitness. The program is designed to increase speed, and strength which is applicable to anyone. 

### Similar Existing Work
I have previously worked on Android apps by taking Mobile Programming at Appalachian State University and developed an app for the final project in that class. I have talked about creating this app for a while in collaberation with my friend Justin Perry. I only created the template for base features for this project so I want to get it up and running. Justin isn't a programmer, but he does do some graphic design so he created a custom icon for the project.

### Previous Experience
* Mobile Device Programming
* Design is already decided upon
* Java programming experience
* XML experience

### Technology
* Android Studio 3.0
* Java
* Android SDK
* Gradle
* Android Device Manager
* Google Pixel 2 XL (My device)

I will be using Android Studio in order to program the application. Java is Android's main programming language and the only one I will use minus the XML required for the visuals. Android Device Manager will be used to emulate a device in order to test features on older phones and phones with smaller screen sizes to make sure the layout fits. I also have my own Android device, Google Pixel 2 XL, that I can test on locally and install the APK for 'real world' usage. Android Studio is powered by Intellij so code reformatting will be provided to make sure my code is cleaned up.

### Risk Areas
* Rusty Android programming

I have programmed Android applications before, but it has been a while. So, I am going to go back over my Mobile Device Programming book to refresh my memory and use as a reference throughout the project.

* Inexperience with Timers, GPS features

Even with my Android programming experience I have never attempted to use these features, but they are discussed in my Android Programming book. I will read over those features and even make dummy applications if I need to in order to learn the concepts hands on.

* Creating and using Databases with Android applications

I have done this before during the Mobile Device Programming class, but I didn't fully understand it and just went through the motions. Once again, I will review the book and make sure that I understand the process and what to do.

* Storing workouts in the database

The workouts are different each day and they don't necessarily follow the same format each time. I'm a little confused on how to store each day's workouts. I will seek out as much help as I can in this area and might see if Dr. Fenwick can be of some help since he teaches Mobile Device Programming.
